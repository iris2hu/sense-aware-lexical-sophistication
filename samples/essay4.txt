Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are always followed by journalists. Do they have to give up their private lives? 
First of all, I think they should accept the fact that they are well known and they should be observed all the time, as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others. Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandals usually increase their fame, even if they do something wrong. 
On the other hand, it is also said that their private lives must not be intruded on, as they are the same as us, human beings. It does not seem possible that we can live without any private life. 
To sum up, although I think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
