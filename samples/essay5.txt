What are  clothes clothes going to look like  a century from now? Are they going to be the same, are they going to be colourful, are men going to wear long skirts and women boxer shorts? This is something that has troubled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry. 
Fashion has made  great progress since the early beginning of the world days. The variety of new fabrics, their colours and quality,  make new fashion statements every day. And the clothes are getting smaller and smaller. In the early 90s it was in fashion for  women to wear only skirts, long ones actually, and for men to wear trousers. In the sixties, people wore clothes with flowers, big glasses, and jeans, and men  had long painted hair. Nowadays women wore wear really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men. Boys pierce their bodies just like girls do and vice versa. If this continues, the two lives will turn the one to the other and soon men will wear skirts. Clothes will get smaller (people will be wearing practically no clothes). People will wore wear extreme clothes which will be really lanky. People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers design but no one wears .
