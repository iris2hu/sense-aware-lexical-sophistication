Dear Mr Robertson, 
Regarding the programme you have organised, is a great idea everything that you have planned everything that you have planned is a great idea, but I would like to suggest something that the students saw in an advertisement. 
It is a good start to go on a sightseeing bus on Monday morning, because we can see all the famous buildings in a few hours. It is will be relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking through over the river. 
The idea of going to the science museum is fantastic. I read about the museum, and it is really interesting for the history of science. After all morning in the museum, it is wonderful and on Tuesday doing some shopping, whereas the students have another idea for Tuesday. 
On Wednesday after we have visited the National Art Gallery, we can have a chat about our next holiday during the free time in the afternoon. 
The advertisement that the students saw is for a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need to cancel the tour on Tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00. 
I look forward to hearing from you. 
Yours sincerely,
